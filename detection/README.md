# Coin detection using OpenCV with Jetson Nano and RealSense

## Getting Started

Python version 3.12.7

```sh
pip install opencv-python
# TODO: write requirements.txt
```

To take pictures with RealSense:

```sh
cd catkin_ws/src
roscore
python coin_picker/get_images/image_sub.py
roslaunch ros…/launch/rs_wrapper.launch
# change launch config file to include depth information
```


## Game Plan

Prerequisite: Learn how to optimize process for our Jetson Nano with [Jetson Inference](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference)

1. Detect and localize the uppermost coins
    - OpenCV?
    - MobileNetV2-SSD: [Collect your own Detection Datasets](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/pytorch-collect-detection.md)
    - Manuever Mirobot
2. Segment the coins
    - rectangular: Use output from previous step as is
    - precise: OpenCV, or a segmentation model
3. Classify the coins
    - SVM
    - ResNet18: [Collect your own Classification Datasets](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/pytorch-collect.md) (standard image size 224x224)

Compare output with every variation in the pipeline.
